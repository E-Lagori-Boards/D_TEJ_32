 @file   PushButton.ino
 @brief  contains routines for GPIO interface of push buttons
 @detail Press BTN-0 in ARIES IoT and GREEN LED will be ON. Press BTN-1 in ARIES IoT and RED LED will be ON 

 * Reference ARIES IoT board: https://vegaprocessors.in/devboards/ariesiot.html
 * Reference ARIES IoT pin diagram: https://vegaprocessors.in/files/ARIES-IoT-Pin-out.pdf
 * 
 * Note:
 * No external connections required for testing this code using ARIES IoT v1
 * Pin no. 22 - Green LED 
 * Pin no. 23 - Blue LED
 * Pin no. 24 - Red LED
 * BLUE,RED and GREEN LED will be in "ON" state for a digital "0" input and in "OFF" state for a digital "1" input.
